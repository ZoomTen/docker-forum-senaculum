To change the logo image is simple.
Open style.css in forum-root-directory. Search for the text .menuForumLogo
Between this { and this } you can find background-image: 
url('menu/default/logo.jpg');
Change the url to that image you want to use as a image. Save the file and your new loggo is visable
in the forum.
 
If you don't want the image to repeat enter this value between { and }:
background-repeat: no-repeat;
When you do this it will be a white space in the right side of the logo. If you want to change color
of that free space enter this between { and }:
background-color: #000000;
This code will make a black background in the logo box.
